<html><body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000"><table><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Problem Statement</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td>There were N ancient nations.
We will denote them using uppercase letters from 'A' to 'A'+N-1.
<br></br><br></br>
All nations were using the same calendar: the new year always started on the same day in each nation.
However, each nation used its own numbering of years.
For example, the years 47, 48, and 49 of nation A could correspond to years 123, 124, and 125 of nation B.
<br></br><br></br>
Each nation had several monarchs over its history.
For each nation, the monarchs are numbered starting from 0, in chronological order.
For example, "C0" denotes the earliest ruling monarch of the nation 'C'.
Each monarch started his rule on the first day of some year.
For each monarch we know the exact years when they ruled, according to the corresponding nation's calendar.
<br></br><br></br>
Manao wants to determine how the calendars of those nations correspond to each other.
To do this, he collected information about various battles that have occurred throughout the history.
For each battle we know the two monarchs that were involved.
For example, "C0-D3" denotes a battle between the monarchs "C0" and "D3".
The information that this battle has occurred tells us that "C0" and "D3" had to rule in the same year.
<br></br><br></br>
Manao now has to answer a bunch of questions.
Each question is of the following form:
"Given all the known information, is it possible that there was a battle between monarchs Xn and Ym?"
<br></br><br></br>
You are given the above information encoded as three vector &lt;string&gt;s: <b>dynasties</b>, <b>battles</b>, and <b>queries</b>.
<br></br><br></br>
For each i, element i of <b>dynasties</b> contains information about all monarchs of the nation 'A'+i:
the year when each of them started ruling, and finally the first year after the last monarch died.
More precisely, <b>dynasties</b>[i] is a space-separated list of increasing integers: the years described above.
For example, if <b>dynasties</b>[0]="42 47 55 63", nation 'A' had three monarchs: "A0" ruled in years 42-46, "A1" ruled in years 47-54, and "A2" ruled in years 55-62. 
<br></br><br></br>
Concatenate the elements of <b>battles</b> to obtain a single string.
The string will represent a space-separated list of battles that are known to have occurred.
Each battle will be given in the above format.
<br></br><br></br>
Each element of <b>queries</b> is a single battle given in the same format.
<br></br><br></br>
Return a string of the same length as the number of elements in <b>queries</b>.
For each i, character i of this string should be 'Y' if the battle in <b>queries</b>[i] is possible, and 'N' otherwise.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Definition</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Class:</td><td>History</td></tr><tr><td>Method:</td><td>verifyClaims</td></tr><tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>vector &lt;string&gt;, vector &lt;string&gt;, vector &lt;string&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Returns:</td><td>string</td></tr><tr><td>Method signature:</td><td>string verifyClaims(vector &lt;string&gt; dynasties, vector &lt;string&gt; battles, vector &lt;string&gt; queries)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(be sure your method is public)</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Notes</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>The Constraints guarantee that there will be at most 10 monarchs in each dynasty.

Manao knows for sure that a battle between nation A's monarch 1 and nation B's monarch 0 occured. He is interested whether the following battles could take place:
<br></br>
<ul>
<li>A0-B0. Since monarchs A0 and B0 both ruled for 1 year only, the battle between them would mean that their rulings coincided. However, B0 battled A1, thus he had to rule later than A0.</li>
<li>A0-B1. We have already seen that monarch B0 ruled later than A0. Therefore monarch B1 ruled even later and could not battle with A0.</li>
<li>A1-B0. This battle is already provided in <b>battles</b>.</li>
<li>A1-B1. This battle could occur if nation A's year 2 coincides with nation B's year 1.</li>
